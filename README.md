# Movie Collection Manager

A small web app running on Node/Express/Mongo sourcing data from TMDB.

You can use this locally or online, I am using Heroku, to manage your own personal movie collection.

More basic features are in place now, searching TMDB, adding and modifying data in your local collection.
